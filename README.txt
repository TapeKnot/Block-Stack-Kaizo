Developers: Benjamin Levy (belevy@wpi.edu) and Sam Randa (swranda@wpi.edu)

Platform: Windows

Files: All files for Bippits can be found in the "game" directory. All engine files can be found in the "dragonfly" folder.

Code Structure: game.cpp starts and stops the game. The "dragonfly" folder contains the header and source files for the engine.

How to Compile:
First, make sure your install of Visual Studio has "Windows 11 SDK (10.0.22621.0)" installed.
Next, extract the contents of the zipped folder "SFML-3.0" to the same directory.

Finally, open the project solution in Visual Studio and build the game. Run the game from Visual Studio (game.cpp will run the "main" function that loads the game).



The final game executable (with cleaned up files) can be found below:
